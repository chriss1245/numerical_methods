# Numerical Methods üêç
A set of numerical methods I reviewed at '``UC3M`` at the data science degree written in python.

These fuctions are tested with 3.9 python version. However the methods should work fine in most of the cases.

If you want to help us... Please make changes and pull requests at the development branch dev.
